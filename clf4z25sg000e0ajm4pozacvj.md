DevOps mainly focuses on addressing the gap between the development and operations teams in software development. It integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve and shorten the development life cycle, enabling faster delivery of the application to the market. It has reduced the complexity of maintaining an application.

Many other methods such as the Waterfall model and Agile model were used before DevOps, so the question lies that why the DevOps method was introduced.

Let's first explore the Waterfall and Agile models before diving into the reasons behind the introduction of DevOps.

### Waterfall Method:

![Waterfall Model](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678594619823/102596d2-4af5-4c2a-8920-cd46b7f9aeb8.jpeg align="center")

Waterfall Model is a traditional approach to software development. In this model, development happens step by step. The main disadvantages of this model are that any new requirements from the client will restart the whole development cycle and it is very expensive to make changes at the end of the project.

Therefore to bridge the gap between the client and developers, Agile Model was introduced.

### Agile Method:

***How this model is different from the waterfall method***:

In this model, the entire process of building an application/software is broken down into small actionable blocks called sprints.

The client initially sends their requirements to the programmer. The programmer then creates a prototype of the application and shares it with the client for feedback. Based on the feedback received, the client provides a list of changes to be made, and the developers then implement these changes to the software.

In this model, the software product is delivered at a faster pace than in the traditional waterfall model, as the development team continuously incorporates client feedback. However, a challenge arises as the product is primarily tested on developers' computers rather than production systems. When the product is deployed to production servers and fails, the operations team may not have sufficient information to resolve the issue, resulting in the product being returned to the development team.

So in this model, we are able to bridge the gap between the client and the developers but still unable to bridge the gap between the developers and the operations team and there comes the idea of DevOps.

### DevOps

DevOps bridge the gap between the developers and the operations team

***There are 8 phases :***

1. ***PLAN:*** In this phase, the client and the developers discuss the project and create a plan.
    
2. ***BUILD***: Developers design and code the application and use tools like ***Git*** to store the code.
    
3. ***TEST***: Using automation testing tools, the application is tested.
    
4. ***INTEGRATE***: After the completion of the testing phase, some new features are integrated automatically into the existing code.
    
5. ***DEPLOY***: After the release, the application is deployed to the production server.
    
6. ***OPERATE***: Following the deployment of the application, the operations team takes over to carry out their tasks such as configuring servers.
    
7. ***MONITOR***: This phase involves monitoring the application, infrastructure, and network components to ensure that they are functioning correctly and meeting the specified performance metrics.
    

To sum it up, DevOps is a method of developing software that helps teams work together more efficiently.DevOps is a great way to improve productivity, reduce costs, and deliver high-quality software faster. It's becoming more and more popular and is changing the way software development is done.
