In today's fast-paced world, with ever-evolving technologies, we humans also have to evolve ourselves and try to adapt to these changes and for doing so we tend to work harder, trying to excel in our lives. But sometimes in the process, we tend to immerse ourselves in our work to such an extent that at times we feel like giving up, we no longer find pleasure in doing things that we once enjoyed and this stage is what we call burnout.

As a novice in the technology field, it is natural to feel inspired by the innovative and fantastic work being done by other professionals using a variety of tech stacks.

I am one such beginner who loves to explore new tech stacks and love to learn and implement them. However, lately while doing so I overburdened myself, resulting in feelings of overwhelm, self-doubt and decreased productivity and concentration. Realizing that my negative feelings were not good for my personal and professional development, I took a break and worked on fixing my burnout.

Below are the steps I took to overcome burnout

* **Taking a break**: I took a few days' breaks and decided not to study. Instead, I utilized this time to do things that I enjoy but had been unable to do due to my heavy study load.
    
* **Spending time with our loved ones:** I spent quality time with my family members, visited different places with them and reconnected with my old friends. This reduced my stress levels and feelings of anxiety to some extent.
    
* **Reading books**: I started reading books, especially on self-development. It calmed my mind and helped me to gain clarity on my priorities and to set realistic goals and develop a sense of purpose.
    
* **Taking self-care:** It is the most important thing. We are so immersed in our work that we often forget how important our health is. A happy and healthy lifestyle is important for reducing stress and burnout.
    
* **Scheduling my days:** Planning is crucial for preventing burnout, I plan my days by dividing them into different sections dedicated to specific tasks. Prioritizing the most important tasks and completing them first, gives a sense of accomplishment and this helps to reduce stress and we can work more efficiently without feeling overwhelmed.
    

**Avoiding the urge to do everything you come across:** I have made the mistake of trying to learn a new technology I come across, which often leads to feeling overwhelmed and unable to concentrate effectively. I used to spend all day trying to learn many things, but I realized I wasn't making meaningful progress and was at risk of burnout. To prevent this, I now prioritize the technologies I learn and avoid taking on too many tasks at once.

These were the ways I try to overcome and prevent burnout.

We should work hard to achieve our aims but at the end of the day we should remember that just as we need to recharge the batteries of our devices, we also need to take breaks and rest when we feel burnt out so that our bodies and minds can recharge and feel better again.
